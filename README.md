<h3>A review theme for wordpress</h3>
<p>Fall 2012</p>

<img src="starred.png">

<p>I designed and developed this theme for wordpress because I believed there was a need for a simpler way to manage reviews within wordpress. I took the design from the initial hand sketches, into photoshop, and then into a functional wordpress theme. I used underscores as starting point for the wordpress development. I used html, css, and php to complete the development of this wordpress theme.<br>
